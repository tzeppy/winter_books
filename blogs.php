This page is going to be interesting. Soon. As I mentioned before - my books are complicated.
They contain a lot of different characters, adventures, and also a variety of themes.
I decided that some of the characters would make a good spokesperson for their favorite topics.
So I am going to blog from the point of view of my characters.
</p>
<ul class="blogs">
  <li>
<b>Margot Toledo</b>, the very knowledgeable and sharp-witted VERS health food chef, is going to share her suggestions and recipes
for people on restricted diets.</li>
  <li>
<b>Jonah Reisberg</b>, the VERS doctor, will give his take on the recent discoveries in the area of brain research. </li>
<li>
<b>Kai Tamura</b>, the VERS yoga guru, will be sharing insights into using yoga for well-being and personal transformation.</li>
<li>
<b>Ona Bell</b>, my protagonist, is going to share her favorite picks of applied art (industrial design, graphic design,
interior design, architecture, e.t.c.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Please note - while the characters are fictional, the information they share is real, based on up-to-date research.
I am going to list my sources in the blogs as well, at the end of each book.
