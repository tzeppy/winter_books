    	 Carmine is dedicated to my great friend Christina Newman. 
	 She was the one who encouraged me to "write a book".
	 And I believe that my protagonist Ona Bell embodies to some degree Christina's fighting spirit.
	 This page is devoted to the story of Christina and her daughter Eva.
 	 Out of every ten dollars of profit from Carmine, I'm giving one dollar to Eva's educational fund.
	 Christina has chosen me to be Eva's Godmother. I think that there are two major gifts I can
	 give Eva - my love, and Education. (The full story is coming up shortly)
